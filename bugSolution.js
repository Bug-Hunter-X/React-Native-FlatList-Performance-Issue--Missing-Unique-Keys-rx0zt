The solution is to always provide a unique `key` prop to each item rendered in the `FlatList`.  The best practice is to use the `keyExtractor` prop.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({item}) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} //This line is crucial
/>
```

This ensures React Native can efficiently track and update items in the list, even with a large dataset. If your data items don't have a unique `id`, you'll need to add one to ensure uniqueness, or generate one using a library if necessary.  Consider using a library like `uuid` to generate universally unique identifiers if you don't have pre-existing unique identifiers in your data.
